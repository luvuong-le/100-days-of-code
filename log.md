# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Thursday, 9th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Worked on CoSketch project to learn websockets with HTML Canvas -> added Login UI
- Looked into how a HashTable is implemented and made some notes
- Coded the basic code structure of a HashTable implementation in JS
- Learned about HTML and CSS progress gauges from [Dcode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjX0FtIZBBVD3YoCcxnDC4g)

**Thoughts:** 
- Working with monorepos and docker is completely different from what I'm used to working with.
- The underlying logic for a HashTable implementation is a bit confusing at times but interesting
- Progress gauges with HTML and CSS is cool! I've always done a normal progress bar

## Day 2: Friday, 10th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Worked on CoSketch project -> Got landing page canvas drawing and web socket client for react setup using WS package for server.

**Thoughts:** 
- Having a harder time setting up WebSockets with React using the native WebSockets Web API and ws Node.JS library instead of using Socket IO like I usually do
- How would you implement rooms with WS? It doesn't come built in like socket IO

## Day 5: Monday, 13th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Focused on watching the JS course on data structures and algorithms by Colt Steele and taking notes.

- Namely Big O Notation! something I've never really understood fully

**Thoughts:** 

- I think this will give my skills as a developer a much needed boost
- I've always had trouble understanding concepts like Big O Notation so this is very helpful

## Day 6 / 7: Tuesday 14th April 2020 & Wednesday 15th April 2020

### Today's Progress

- Continued with course on Udemy

- Tried out new knowledge with some Big O Notation questions (need more practice though)

- Also thinking of creating a blog separate from my personal website but have other projects to finish first!

## Day 8 & 9: Thursday 16th April 2020 & Friday 17th April 2020

### Today's Progress

- These Udemy courses sure take a while but worth it! 
- Messing around more with docker & docker-compose basics

PC decided to BSOD on me so spent time fixing that and decided to remove my dual boot ubuntu finally...
