# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Thursday, 9th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Worked on CoSketch project to learn websockets with HTML Canvas -> added Login UI
- Looked into how a HashTable is implemented and made some notes
- Coded the basic code structure of a HashTable implementation in JS
- Learned about HTML and CSS progress gauges from [Dcode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjX0FtIZBBVD3YoCcxnDC4g)

**Thoughts:** 
- Working with monorepos and docker is completely different from what I'm used to working with.
- The underlying logic for a HashTable implementation is a bit confusing at times but interesting
- Progress gauges with HTML and CSS is cool! I've always done a normal progress bar

## Day 2: Friday, 10th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Worked on CoSketch project -> Got landing page canvas drawing and web socket client for react setup using WS package for server.

**Thoughts:** 
- Having a harder time setting up WebSockets with React using the native WebSockets Web API and ws Node.JS library instead of using Socket IO like I usually do
- How would you implement rooms with WS? It doesn't come built in like socket IO
