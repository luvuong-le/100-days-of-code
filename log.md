# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Thursday, 9th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Worked on CoSketch project to learn websockets with HTML Canvas -> added Login UI
- Looked into how a HashTable is implemented and made some notes
- Coded the basic code structure of a HashTable implementation in JS
- Learned about HTML and CSS progress gauges from [Dcode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjX0FtIZBBVD3YoCcxnDC4g)

**Thoughts:** 
- Working with monorepos and docker is completely different from what I'm used to working with.
- The underlying logic for a HashTable implementation is a bit confusing at times but interesting
- Progress gauges with HTML and CSS is cool! I've always done a normal progress bar

## Day 2: Friday, 10th April, 2020

### Today's Progress

- Worked on CoSketch project -> Got landing page canvas drawing and web socket client for react setup using WS package for server.

**Thoughts:** 
- Having a harder time setting up WebSockets with React using the native WebSockets Web API and ws Node.JS library instead of using Socket IO like I usually do
- How would you implement rooms with WS? It doesn't come built in like socket IO

Another day another distraction and ended up doing this instead..Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat

Although I have real respect for online code editors like codepen who implement this properly. It's definitely a very difficult thing to do
